# Risky choice task
Decision under risk is characterized by making choices between offers with fully known odds and outcomes. For example, would you prefer a 100% chance of $50 or 40% chance of $200 and a 60% chance of nothing? The former is a "surebet", the latter a lottery. Different individuals would choose differently, becasue there is variability in individual "risk attitudes". To study the neural basis of risky choice, we first need to train animals on a version of risky choice without verbal instructions. In this task, the side of the surebet port is cued by blue lights, and the lottery by yellow lights. On each trial, the animal hears a sound whose frequency conveys the lottery magnitude, while the lottery probability is fixed. I used the LED color to indicate the port identity rather than its spatial location because I want to be able to distinguish the side bias from the surebet-lottery bias.
